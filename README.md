- **Snowflake** – Cloud-based data warehouse  
- **Apache Airflow** – Workflow automation and orchestration  
- **Python** – Scripting and automation  
- **Docker** – Deployment
- **Git** – Version control  

## Features
- Automated data ingestion from multiple sources  
- Transformation and modeling using dbt  
- Scheduled workflows using Airflow  
- Scalable and modular architecture
